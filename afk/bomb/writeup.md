# Writeup [A BOMB! Have you tried turning it on and off again?](README.md)  

In this task, you get a few hints that this has something to do with TV series [IT Crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IT_Crowd):
1. Title: "Have you tried turning it on and off again?"
2. [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/6bH-MdVCLWM) shows the intro of the TV series.o

We have another hint that says you should call the new emergency number, 
which is a reference to [this](https://youtu.be/ab8GtuPdrUQ) part of the series. 

The new emergency phone number is the code to disarm the bomb:

```
0118 999 881 999 119 7253
```

Paste the code into the bomb before it has counted down to 0,
and get the flag:

```
TG18{Fire! fire! help me! Looking forward to hearing from you}
```

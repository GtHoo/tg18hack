# Writeup [Broken QR](README.md)


We put four posters around the ship. 
They were placed at the following places:

1. Creative Lounge
2. UiO-Stand
3. The information desk.
4. Westerdahls stand. 

You have to put these four posters together, and it patch up so that a QR reader works on them.

When the QR code is patched together, you scan it to get the flag. The flag is:
```
TG18{d0nt_f0rget_t0_dr1nk_w4t3r}
```

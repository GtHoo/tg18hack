# Writeup [Maximum Strange Dots](README.md)

There is a little hint in the task title. This is a Maxicode. 
Maxicode is a type of barcode. You may read more about Maxicode [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MaxiCode).

By using a barcode reader with support for Maxicode and getting a clear enough image, you get the flag:
`TG18{did y0u know th3r3 are lo4ds of b4rcode types? Th1s is a maxicode.}`.

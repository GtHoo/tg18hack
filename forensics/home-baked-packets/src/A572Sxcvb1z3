# S3cret Packet crafting recipe:

Start by gathering the RAW ingredients and mix them together with space:
    * "can"
    * "i"
    * "haz"
    * "flagz"
    * "now"
    * "plz"

Now start preparing your TCP layer:
1. Start with a dash of reserved bit
2. Next add some URGENT SYN flags
3. Finally add a splash of dport 1337

And now prepare the IP layer:
1. Mark with dst 167.99.35.80

Wrap the TCP layer around the raw mix.
Wrap the TCP layer in IP layer

Finally, send the packet in owen and hope for the best.
(The outcome might be different than you expect!)
